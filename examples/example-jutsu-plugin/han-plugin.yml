  # Example validation hook - runs on Stop and SubagentStop events
  # This hook demonstrates a simple validation that always passes
  validate-example:
    event:

      - SubagentStop
    command: bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/validate-example.sh"

    # Only run if certain files were changed (optional)
    # if_changed:

  # Uncomment to enable directory-scoped hooks
  # project-check:
  #   event: Stop
  #   command: bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/project-check.sh"
