# Review Task Alignment

Before stopping work, review the conversation to ensure alignment with the original task:

## Review Checklist

1. **Original Intent**: Does the most recent work align with the user's initial request or the established goal?

2. **Scope Adherence**: Have we stayed within the original scope, or have we drifted into tangential work?

3. **User Expectations**: Does the current state match what the user asked for in their most recent prompt?

4. **Completion Status**: If the original task is incomplete, acknowledge what remains to be done.

## If Misalignment Detected

If you notice the work has drifted from the original intent:
- Briefly acknowledge the misalignment
- Summarize what was requested vs. what was done
- Ask the user if they want to continue in the current direction or refocus on the original task

## If Aligned

If the work aligns with the original request, proceed with stopping without additional commentary.

**Note**: This is an internal check. Only mention misalignment if it's significant enough to warrant user attention.
