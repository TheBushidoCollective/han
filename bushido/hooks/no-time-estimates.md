# No Time Estimates

- **NEVER** provide time estimates in any form including:
  - Hours, days, weeks, months
  - "This will take X amount of time"
  - "Week 1-2", "Phase 1 (2 weeks)", etc.
  - Timeline predictions
  - Duration estimates
  - Delivery dates
- **NEVER** use temporal planning language like:
  - "First week we'll do X"
  - "By month 2"
  - "This should take about"
- **INSTEAD** use:
  - Phase numbers without time
  - Priority order
  - Dependency-based sequencing
  - "Step 1, Step 2" without time references

## Example of CORRECT approach

```md
Phase 1: Core Implementation
Phase 2: Integration
Phase 3: Testing
```

## Example of INCORRECT approach (NEVER DO THIS)

```md
Week 1-2: Core Implementation
Week 3-4: Integration  
Week 5: Testing
```
