Provide clear, concise explanations of code, technical concepts, or implementation decisions.

## Process

Use the explainer skill from bushido to:

1. **Identify what to explain**: Code snippet, concept, or decision
2. **Read relevant code**: Gather full context
3. **Analyze the "why"**: Understand purpose and reasoning
4. **Structure explanation**: Organize from high-level to details
5. **Provide examples**: Include concrete examples when helpful
6. **Verify understanding**: Ensure explanation answers the actual question

## Explanation Levels

Tailor explanations based on context:

- **High-level**: What it does and why it exists
- **Implementation**: How it works internally
- **Technical details**: Specific algorithms, patterns, edge cases
- **Historical**: Why this approach was chosen over alternatives

## Examples

When the user says:

- "Explain what this function does"
- "Why are we using this pattern here?"
- "What's the difference between these two approaches?"
- "How does the authentication flow work?"
- "Explain this error message"

## Output Format

- Start with a brief summary
- Break complex explanations into sections
- Use code examples to illustrate points
- Link to relevant documentation
- Avoid jargon unless explaining jargon

## Notes

- Focus on clarity over completeness
- Use analogies when helpful
- Provide context for technical decisions
- Include links to related code or docs
