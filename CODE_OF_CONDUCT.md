# Code of Conduct

## The Bushido Code

This community is built on the seven virtues of Bushido. All participants are expected to embody these principles in their interactions.

### The Seven Virtues

**1. Righteousness (義 - Gi)**
Make decisions based on what is right, not what is convenient. Be honest in your assessments and fair in your judgments.

**2. Courage (勇 - Yu)**
Speak up when something is wrong. Challenge the status quo constructively. Take responsibility for your actions and decisions.

**3. Compassion (仁 - Jin)**
Be kind to others, especially newcomers. Help those who are struggling. Consider the impact of your words and actions on others.

**4. Respect (礼 - Rei)**
Treat everyone with dignity. Honor the contributions of others. Listen before speaking and seek to understand before being understood.

**5. Honesty (誠 - Makoto)**
Be truthful in all communications. Acknowledge mistakes openly. Give credit where it is due.

**6. Honor (名誉 - Meiyo)**
Act in ways that reflect well on yourself and the community. Stand behind your words and commitments. Maintain the trust others place in you.

**7. Loyalty (忠義 - Chugi)**
Support the community and its members. Follow through on commitments. Contribute to the long-term health of the project.
