# AI-DLC Workflows
#
# Each workflow is a named sequence of hats. Override or extend
# by creating .ai-dlc/workflows.yml in your project root.
#
# Format:
#   workflow-name:
#     description: Short description
#     hats: [hat1, hat2, hat3]
#     integrator: true|false  # Whether to run integrator after all units (default: true)
#
# The integrator hat runs after all units complete, but its behavior
# depends on the VCS change strategy:
# - trunk: Validates auto-merged state on main
# - intent: Creates single PR for entire intent
# - unit/bolt: Verifies all unit PRs were merged (no-op)
