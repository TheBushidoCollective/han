# AI-DLC Settings Example
# Place this file at: .ai-dlc/settings.yml
#
# These settings configure how AI-DLC manages version control for your project.
# Settings can be overridden per-intent by adding git: or jj: keys to intent.md frontmatter.

# Git configuration (used when repository is git-based)
git:
  # How changes are organized into branches:
  # - trunk: All work on main branch, no feature branches
  # - unit: One branch per unit of work (default, recommended for most teams)
  # - bolt: One branch per intent with squashed commits
  # - intent: One long-lived branch per intent with linear history
  change_strategy: unit

  # Whether to create a PR for reviewing the elaborated intent before planning.
  # Useful for getting stakeholder buy-in on scope before implementation.
  elaboration_review: true

  # Default branch name. Set to 'auto' to detect from origin/HEAD,
  # or specify explicitly (e.g., 'main', 'master', 'develop')
  default_branch: auto

  # Uncomment to automatically merge completed unit branches to default branch
  # auto_merge: true

  # Uncomment to squash commits when auto-merging (only applies when auto_merge is true)
  # auto_squash: true

# Jujutsu (jj) configuration (used when repository uses jj)
# jj:
#   change_strategy: unit
#   elaboration_review: true
#   default_branch: auto
