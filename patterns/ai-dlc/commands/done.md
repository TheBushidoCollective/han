description: (Internal) Complete the AI-DLC task (only valid from the last hat)
internal: true
---

## Name

`jutsu-ai-dlc:done` - Mark the AI-DLC task as complete.

## Synopsis

```
/done
```

## Description

**Internal command** - Called by the AI during `/construct`, not directly by users.

Marks the AI-DLC task as complete. This command is **guarded** - it can only be called from the last hat in the workflow (typically reviewer).

- Only the last hat (reviewer) can complete
- All completion criteria must be verified
- This ends the AI-DLC loop for this task

## Implementation

### Step 1: Load Current State

```javascript
// Intent-level state is stored on current branch (intent branch)
const state = JSON.parse(han_keep_load({ scope: "branch", key: "iteration.json" }));
const workflow = state.workflow || ["elaborator", "planner", "builder", "reviewer"];
const currentIndex = workflow.indexOf(state.hat);
const lastIndex = workflow.length - 1;
```

### Step 2: Verify Last Hat

```javascript
if (currentIndex !== lastIndex) {
  const lastHat = workflow[lastIndex];
  return `Cannot complete from ${state.hat} hat. Only the ${lastHat} can mark the task as done.\n\nUse /advance to progress to the next hat.`;
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Criteria Met

Load and check completion criteria:

```javascript
// Intent-level state from current branch (intent branch)
const criteria = han_keep_load({ scope: "branch", key: "completion-criteria.md" });
```

Display criteria and confirm each is satisfied:
```
## Completion Criteria Check

- [x] Users can log in with Google OAuth
- [x] Login failure shows descriptive error message
- [x] Session persists across page refreshes
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass

All criteria satisfied!
```

If any criteria are NOT met, output:
```
Cannot complete - the following criteria are not satisfied:

- [ ] {unsatisfied criterion}

Use /fail to return to builder and address these items.
```

### Step 3b: Update Current Unit Status to Completed

If working on a unit-based task, mark the current unit as completed:

```bash
# Source the DAG and strategies libraries
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/dag.sh"
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/strategies.sh"

# Get the current unit file from state (intent-level from current branch / intent branch)
INTENT_SLUG=$(han keep load intent-slug --quiet)
INTENT_DIR=".ai-dlc/${INTENT_SLUG}"
CURRENT_UNIT=$(cat iteration.json | jq -r '.currentUnit // empty')

# If there's a current unit, mark it completed
if [ -n "$CURRENT_UNIT" ] && [ -f "$INTENT_DIR/${CURRENT_UNIT}.md" ]; then
  update_unit_status "$INTENT_DIR/${CURRENT_UNIT}.md" "completed"
  echo "Unit ${CURRENT_UNIT} marked as completed."
fi
```

**Note:** This happens in the intent worktree (`/tmp/ai-dlc-{intent-slug}/`), not the unit worktree. The orchestrator is responsible for tracking unit progress.

### Step 3b-2: Handle VCS Strategy Actions

Based on the configured change strategy, perform appropriate VCS actions:

```bash
# Source strategies library
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/strategies.sh"

# Get the current configuration
CONFIG=$(get_ai_dlc_config "$INTENT_DIR")
STRATEGY=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq -r '.change_strategy')
AUTO_MERGE=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq -r '.auto_merge // "false"')

# Check if all units are now complete
INTENT_COMPLETE="false"
if is_dag_complete "$INTENT_DIR"; then
  INTENT_COMPLETE="true"
fi

# Determine if we should create a PR
if should_create_pr "$STRATEGY" "true" "" "$INTENT_COMPLETE"; then
  echo "Creating PR for completed ${STRATEGY}..."

  # Generate PR title and body
  PR_TITLE="[AI-DLC] ${INTENT_SLUG}: ${CURRENT_UNIT}"
  case "$STRATEGY" in
    unit)
      PR_BODY="## Summary

Completed unit: ${CURRENT_UNIT}

## Generated by AI-DLC

This PR was created by the AI-DLC pattern following the **unit** strategy."
      ;;
    intent)
      PR_TITLE="[AI-DLC] ${INTENT_SLUG}"
      PR_BODY="## Summary

Completed intent: ${INTENT_SLUG}

## Generated by AI-DLC

This PR was created by the AI-DLC pattern following the **intent** strategy."
      ;;
  esac

  PR_URL=$(create_pr "$PR_TITLE" "$PR_BODY")
  if [ -n "$PR_URL" ]; then
    echo "PR created: $PR_URL"
  fi
fi

# Determine if we should auto-merge (trunk strategy)
if should_auto_merge "$STRATEGY" "true" "true" "$AUTO_MERGE"; then
  echo "Auto-merging completed unit to trunk..."

  SQUASH=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq -r '.auto_squash // "false"')
  if auto_merge "$SQUASH"; then
    echo "Successfully merged ${CURRENT_UNIT} to trunk."
  else
    echo "Warning: Auto-merge failed. Manual merge required."
  fi
fi
```

**Strategy behaviors:**
- **trunk**: Auto-merges to default branch after validation passes
- **bolt**: Creates PR per bolt (handled elsewhere)
- **unit**: Creates PR when unit completes
- **intent**: Creates PR only when entire intent is complete

### Step 3c: Check for More Units (Unit-Based Workflows)

For unit-based tasks, check if all units are now complete or if there are more ready units:

```bash
# Source the DAG library
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/dag.sh"

# Check if DAG is complete (all units finished)
if is_dag_complete "$INTENT_DIR"; then
  echo "All units completed! Task is fully done."
  # Continue to Step 4 to mark the entire task complete
else
  # Find next ready units
  READY_UNITS=$(find_ready_units "$INTENT_DIR")

  if [ -n "$READY_UNITS" ]; then
    # More units are ready to work on
    echo "Unit completed. Ready units available: $READY_UNITS"

    # Reset hat to builder (or first hat after planner) for the next unit
    state.hat = workflow[2]  // Typically "builder"
    state.currentUnit = null  // Will be set by /construct
    // Intent-level state saved to current branch (intent branch)
    han_keep_save({
      scope: "branch",
      key: "iteration.json",
      content: JSON.stringify(state)
    })

    # Output status and continue construction
    echo "Moving to next unit. Run /construct to continue."
    return  # Do NOT proceed to Step 4 (full task completion)
  else
    # Units remain but are blocked
    BLOCKED_UNITS=$(find_blocked_units "$INTENT_DIR")
    echo "Warning: Remaining units are blocked:"
    echo "$BLOCKED_UNITS"
    # Continue to wait or alert user
    return
  fi
fi
```

**Note:** If there are more units, `/done` does NOT mark the task as complete. Instead, it resets the hat and signals the construct loop to pick up the next unit.

### Step 4: Mark Task Complete (Only When All Units Done)

```javascript
state.status = "complete";
// Intent-level state saved to current branch (intent branch)
han_keep_save({
  scope: "branch",
  key: "iteration.json",
  content: JSON.stringify(state)
});
```

### Step 5: Summary

Output a completion summary:

```javascript
const workflowName = state.workflowName || "default";
const workflowHats = state.workflow.join(" → ");
```

```
## AI-DLC Task Complete!

**Total iterations:** {iteration count}
**Workflow:** {workflowName} ({workflowHats})

### What Was Built
{Summary from intent}

### Criteria Satisfied
{List of completion criteria}

### Next Steps

Based on your change strategy (`{strategy}`):

**For trunk strategy:**
- Changes have been auto-merged to `{default_branch}`
- Clean up worktree: `git worktree remove /tmp/ai-dlc-{intent-slug}`
- Start new task: Run `/reset` then `/elaborate`

**For unit/bolt strategies:**
- Review and merge the PR(s) created for each unit/bolt
- Clean up worktree after merging: `git worktree remove /tmp/ai-dlc-{intent-slug}`
- Start new task: Run `/reset` then `/elaborate`

**For intent strategy:**
- Review and merge the single PR containing all changes
- Clean up worktree after merging: `git worktree remove /tmp/ai-dlc-{intent-slug}`
- Start new task: Run `/reset` then `/elaborate`

Worktree location: /tmp/ai-dlc-{intent-slug}/
