# Blueprints Documentation Requirements

## What are Blueprints?

Blueprints are **repository-wide system design documents** that describe the architecture, behavior, and implementation of major systems in a codebase. They provide a high-level understanding of how systems work, their components, and how they interact.

## Location: ALWAYS at Repository Root

**CRITICAL:** The `blueprints/` directory must ALWAYS be at the repository root, never in subdirectories or packages.

```
my-repo/
├── blueprints/           # CORRECT - at repo root
│   └── {system-name}.md
├── packages/
│   └── some-package/     # NEVER put blueprints/ here
└── src/
```

Blueprints describe systems that may span multiple packages or directories. A single system (like "authentication" or "hook-dispatch") may have implementation files across different parts of the codebase, but there should be ONE blueprint document at the repo root that describes the entire system.

## Tool Usage

**Use native Claude Code tools** to interact with blueprints:

- `Glob("blueprints/*.md")` - List all blueprint files
- `Grep("keyword", path: "blueprints/")` - Search blueprints by keyword in name or content
- `Read("blueprints/{name}.md")` - Read full blueprint content
- `Write("blueprints/{name}.md", content)` - Create or update blueprints (include frontmatter)

**When working on implementation changes:**

1. **Before coding** - Use `Glob` and `Grep` to find relevant blueprints
2. **Before modifying** - Use `Read` to understand current documentation
3. **After changes** - Use `Write` to update documentation (always include frontmatter)

## When to Update blueprints/

Update or create blueprints/ documentation when making changes that involve:

- **New features** - Document the feature's purpose, behavior, and API
- **Architecture changes** - Update system design documentation
- **API modifications** - Document endpoint changes, parameters, responses
- **Configuration changes** - Document new options and their effects
- **Behavioral changes** - Update docs if system behavior differs from before

## blueprints/ Directory Structure

```
{repo-root}/blueprints/
├── {system-name}.md    # One file per system/feature/component
└── {another-system}.md
```

**Note:** The index at `.claude/rules/blueprints/blueprints-index.md` is auto-generated by the SessionStart hook. You don't need to maintain it manually.

## Blueprint File Format

**REQUIRED:** Each blueprint file must include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `summary`:

```markdown
---
name: system-name
summary: Brief one-line description of the system
---

# {System Name}

Detailed description of what this system does.

## Overview

High-level explanation of the system's purpose and role.

## Architecture

How the system is structured (components, data flow, dependencies).

## API / Interface

Public methods, commands, endpoints, or configuration options.

## Behavior

How the system behaves in different scenarios.

## Files

Key files involved in this system:
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description
```

**Frontmatter Rules:**

- `name` must match the filename (without .md extension)
- `summary` should be a single line (used for search/discovery)
- Frontmatter is required for index generation

## De-duplication Rules

**CRITICAL:** Before creating a new blueprint, ALWAYS check existing blueprints:

```
# 1. List all existing blueprints
Glob("blueprints/*.md")

# 2. Search for blueprints related to your topic
Grep("auth", path: "blueprints/", output_mode: "files_with_matches")

# 3. Read existing blueprint to check coverage
Read("blueprints/authentication.md")

# 4. Only create new if truly distinct, otherwise update existing
Write("blueprints/authentication.md", updated_content_with_frontmatter)
```

Rules:

1. **Always search first** - Use `Glob` and `Grep` to find existing documentation
2. **Read before writing** - Use `Read` to understand current state
3. **Extend, don't duplicate** - Update existing blueprints for related functionality
4. **Use consistent naming** - Match the system/feature name used in code

## When NOT to Document

Skip blueprints/ documentation for:

- Bug fixes that don't change behavior
- Refactoring without API changes
- Test additions
- Documentation-only changes
- Minor style/formatting updates

## Ongoing Maintenance

When modifying a system that has blueprints/ documentation:

1. Read the existing blueprint first
2. Update the blueprint alongside code changes
3. Keep the blueprint accurate - remove outdated information
4. Cross-reference related blueprints if behavior overlaps
