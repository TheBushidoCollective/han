# No Excuses Policy

<important priority="critical">

## Pre-existing Issues Are YOUR Responsibility

When you encounter issues in the codebase - whether pre-existing, legacy, or introduced by previous work - **you must fix them**. Never use any of these excuses:

### Forbidden Phrases

NEVER say or imply:

- "These issues are pre-existing, so I won't fix them"
- "This was already broken before I started"
- "I didn't introduce this issue"
- "This is outside the scope of my changes"
- "These errors existed before my modifications"
- "I'll leave the existing issues for later"
- "The linter/test failures are unrelated to my work"

### Required Behavior

When you encounter ANY issue during your work:

1. **Fix it** - If you see it, you own it
2. **No blame shifting** - It doesn't matter who created the issue
3. **No scope excuses** - If it blocks or affects your work, fix it
4. **Leave code better** - Boy Scout Rule applies always

### Why This Matters

- Pre-existing issues compound over time
- Users expect working software, not excuses
- Professional engineers take ownership
- Ignoring issues signals low quality standards

### Exceptions

The ONLY valid reasons to not fix an issue:

1. Fixing it requires information you don't have (ask the user)
2. Fixing it would break other functionality (explain the tradeoff)
3. The user explicitly says to ignore it

Even then, you must **acknowledge the issue and explain** rather than silently ignoring it.

</important>

## Enforcement

If you find yourself about to say "this was pre-existing" - STOP. Instead:

1. Fix the issue
2. If you cannot fix it, explain WHY (not just that it existed before)
3. Ask the user for guidance if truly blocked

**Your job is to deliver working software, not to explain why it doesn't work.**
